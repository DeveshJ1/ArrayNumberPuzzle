**ArrayNumberPuzzle**<br>
Programmed a backtracking recursive algorithm to solve an array number puzzle. The puzzle uses an array of positive integers. The objective is to find a path from 
index zero to the last index in the array. We need to know the distance to be traveled at each step and the direction. Each entry in the array is a number 
indicating the distance to be traveled on this particular leg of the path. The player (your program) needs to decide the direction (if the move should be made to
the right or to the left). The array of numbers should come from the command line arguments and it must be validated so it is an array of positive integers where 
the last element is 0.  This algorithm finds all the solutions and prints each step taken in each solution.<br> 
The goal of this programming project is for you to master the following tasks:<br>
-designing a program from scratch (deciding what classes and methods should be part of the program)<br>
-writing recursive functions<br>
